I cloned this repo from a guy named Richard Gao.
He's a PhD student in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and works at Bradley Voytek's lab.

This is from his blog 'Roemer Has It' and is about:
The Hilbert Transform, Instantaneous Power/Phase/Frequency, and Negative Frequencies in Neuroscience

Check it out!
